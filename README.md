# Currents: Developing Interactive Installations with Cinder

Spring 2017, MFA Design and Technology, Parsons School of Design

Weili Shi, Luobin Wang

This course will be based on Cinder â€” an open source creative coding library. Students will learn to code using C++ and Cinder in the context of developing interactive installations. Offering high performance and solid roubustness, Cinder is widely used as the primary production platform in creative agencies for the development of interactive installations. Starting with a recap of object-oriented programing with C++, we will then explore Cinder's capability in domains like graphics, animation, audio, video, mathetatics, and interactivity, at the same time getting familiar the best practices of industrial-level creative coding. In the second half of the semester, students will consolidate their learning by implementing their own interactive installations in groups. Guest lectures will also be arranged to introduce the prototyping and production of real-world projects.

Prerequisite: Students need to be comfortable with at least one creative coding platform (such as Processing, openFrameworks, etc.), and have done a major project with it.
