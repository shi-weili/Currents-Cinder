# Currents: Developing Interactive Installations with Cinder

Spring 2017, MFA Design and Technology, Parsons School of Design

This course will be based on Cinderâ€”an open source creative coding library. Because of its performance and roubustness, Cinder is widely used as the primary production platform in creative agencies for the development of interactive installations. In this course, students will learn to code with C++ and Cinder in the context of developing interactive installations. We will start with a recap of object-oriented programing with C++, and explore Cinder's capability in domains like graphics, animation, audio, video, mathetatics, and interactivity, while conveying the best practices of industrial-level creative coding. In the second half of the semester, students will consolidate thier learning by implementing their own interactive installations in groups. Guest lectures will also be arranged to introduce the prototyping and production of real-world projects.

Prerequisite: Students need to be comfortable with at least one creative coding platform (such as Processing, openFrameworks, etc.), and have done a major project using creative coding.
